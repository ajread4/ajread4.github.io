# ShmooCon 2022
I spoke at ShmooCon 2022 about my thesis research completed at The George Washington University for my Masters of Science in Cybersecurity in Computer Science (yes, that is two "ins"). The research focused on a graph theory implementation of anomaly detection using process creation logs. The full video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CC8076zYQ4&t=150s). 

The presentation at the conference can be found [here](https://github.com/ajread4/procaid_presentations).
