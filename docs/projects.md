# CTF-Help
I love competing in CTFS. Over the years, I have compiled a bunch of techniques, tools, and ideas for solving various challenges. CTF-Help can be found [here](https://aj-read.gitbook.io/ctf-help). 

# Threat Hunting
Based on my experience in the industry and items that I have collected over the years via classes, I created a few guides that helped me identify malicious activity. The guides can be found [here](https://aj-read.gitbook.io/windows-threat-hunting). 

# Prefetcher
A nice tool that you can use to analyze prefetch files during IR or threat hunting operations. I got some inspiration from a previous repo that was some-what out of date. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/ajread4/prefetcher). 

# AWSConfigFinder
I loved the SEC541 class for Cloud Threat Hunting that I completed. With the remaining lab time and using some inspiration from the instructor, I made a small detection engine for differences in AWS Configs. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/ajread4/awsconfigfinder). 

# Interesting-Data
While on a penetration testing operation, PowerSploit wasnt working for me due to some dependency issues. So, I created my own! Code can be found [here](https://github.com/ajread4/Interesting-Data). 

# Nessus Crosswalk
I was completing some end of year statistics and there was no efficient solution for identifying Nessus results with the CISA Known and Exploited Vulnerabilites (KEV) [database](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog). Code can be found [here](https://github.com/ajread4/nessus_crosswalk).
